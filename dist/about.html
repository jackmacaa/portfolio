          <p>
            I have recently graduated from Southern Cross University with a
            Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in software development.
            I am curious by nature and am not satisfied with things just
            working, I want to know how and why things work. I am obsessive and
            will use this to my advantage to learn as much as I can as fast as I
            can. I am still not sure what kind of programmer I want to be yet,
            but I can see that mobile devices and web based systems will be very
            important in the future. Currently I understand that I only have
            introductory level skills but will never stop learning and am
            willing to work long hours and any days of the week.

          <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
          <h6>HTML, SASS and JAVASCRIPT</h6>
          <p>
            This project is an example of my skills to layout and style a
            website. During this project i learnt how to use SASS over CSS and
            can now see how handy it will be.

            This page i made first to demonstrate my skills with JS, during this
            project i learnt how to manipulate the DOM. I made this project over
            a month ago and shows how far i have come during this time.

          <h3>Live Poker tracker</h3>

          <p>
            This project has been an idea of mine for a long time, it has
            combined my interest in poker and could actually be a useful tool.
            The project was intended to show how i can use php and sql to save,
            delete and display data from a database.
